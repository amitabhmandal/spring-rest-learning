XML over HTTP is also known as XML Remote Procedure Call.

Around 2003, another standard around XML which became very popular is known
as SOAP. (Simple Object Access Protocol).

The standard defined the structure of the message package that is exchanged between the consumer and the
producer. It also defines the security, transactions and other security standards.
 

Need to understand what SOAP is and what kind of advantages it provides over XML RPC.

XML technologies worked very well till the point we saw emergence of mobile technologies.

When these mobile technologies emerged then the developers started to complain about the usage of XML 
and SOAP protocol.

XML Problem #1
XML is very heavy in network traffic. Hence a device which is working on 3G then bandwith would be 
the greatest challenge.

XML Problem #2
Parsing of XML is CPU intensive and memory intensive.

XML Problem #3
Slow performance of XML on browser front end not desired.

XML Problem #4
It also made the code very complex.

XML Problem #5
Because of XML processing it made the mobile batteries drain faster.

XML Problem #6
Standards and versions of standards caused confusion and complexity.

To solve these above problems JSON came into Picture

JSON - Java Script Object Notation.

Like XML it is a data format. It is launched in 2002.

However it became quite popular in 2006 when Google and Yahoo launched it's rest API's.

Rest Stands for Representational state transfer.
