We can use a PUT method or PATCH Http method to update a resource


PUT - We should use PUT when we want to update all attributes of an existing resource
effectively replace.

We can also use PUT to create a new resource however it is not recommended.


PACTH is used when are updating part of the resource and not all of it.


In case of Success
Code = 200
Code = 204 No content
Code = 201 Created 

We can send back the resource which is optional back in the body of the response
OPTIONAL

No need to send the link - OPTIONAL

We dont want to send back the information as we are expecting that they have already
the information which is being send for update hence it does not make any sense to 
send back the information and waste network band-width


In case of failure there is no difference between POST as it can be handled in the same
fashion.
