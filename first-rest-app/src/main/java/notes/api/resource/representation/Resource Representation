It is always a good practise to provide multiple data formats

It is always benenficial to design your api's in such a way that the API can support
multiple formats.

There are 3 ways in which the Application developer or the API client 
can request to send back data in a specific format
==========================
OPTION 1: Query Parameter:
==========================
We can build an API Which can allow the client to use the query parameter 
For example
/search?q=iphone&format=xml

==============================
OPTION 2: HTTP HEADER: ACCEPTS
==============================

Accepts : application/json

=================================
OPTION 3: Resource Format Suffix:
=================================
For example to get the programme listing for today we can suffic the resource with the
format required.
/programmes/schedules/fm/today.json

Use of HTTP Accept header is not so common
Most providers set the default format as json


Irrespective of which format type the client might have requested
our response should contain the following information

Content-Type:
HTTP Status code : 415 if the client does not support the requested format
In the documentation of your API, we should list all supported formats.
