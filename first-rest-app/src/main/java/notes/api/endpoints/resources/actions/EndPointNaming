In order to invoke the API we need the endpoint or URL

For the given URL

https://api.walmart.com/v1/items

Here https://api.walmart.com is the BASE URL

Here 'items' is the resource. This is the resource on which we will carry out CRUD operations

'v1' is the version. For the time being let's ignore version


Hence the API Consists of 3 parts
1. BASE URL = THIS WILL REMAIN THE SAME IRRESPECTIVE OF WHICH EVER API WE CALL OF THAT WEBSITE
2. VERSION  = THIS IS THE VERSION OF THE API
3. RESOURCE = IS THE RESOURCE ON WHICH WE MIGHT NEED TO PERFORM AN OPERATION

Best PRACTICES FOR BASE URL
1. AVOID USING YOUR WWW DOMAIN FOR API. IF POSSIBLE http://www.acme.com should be avoided
2. KEEP YOUR BASE URL SIMPLE. THE API IS CATERING TO DEVELOPERS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THE BASE URL.
3. IF POSSIBLE USE A SUB DOMAIN. EXAMPLE: https://api.twitter.com.  Here 'api' is the sub-domain.
4. Or USE A SERERATE DOMAIN IF WE CAN AFFORD IT. EXAMPLE. https://api.walmartlabs.com

For THE RESOURCES FOLLOWING RULES ARE APPLICABLE

1. NEVER USE VERBS FOR RESOURCES BUT NOUNS FOR EXAMPLE:
Walmart
/items - for collections of items
/items/{id} - for a particular item

LinkedIn
/people - for collection of people 
/people/{id} - for a paricular person information


/programmes - for collection of programmes being telecast 
/programmes{id} - for a particular programme information

Hence never it should getProgrammes or getPeople or getItems.

USE NOUNS TO IDENTIFY RESOURCES
USE PLURAL FOR RESOURCES.

WHEN WE ARE HANDLING RESOURCES THEN WE ARE USING NOUNS TO NAME THEM

SO HOW DO WE NAME RESOURCES WHICH DO NOT PERFORM ANY CRUD OPERATIONS BUT REPRESENT 
ACTIONS
FOR EXAMPLE
calculatingTax - that is not a crud operation but an action
generating some kind of report is not a crud operation.

Uber 
has price /estimates/price API.
twitter 
has /friendships/lookup
walmart
/search?query

Associations:
Resources contains other resources
Managing resource(s) within a resource

Recommendation when handling association between resources
is to avoid deep nesting
Hence maximum nesting recommended = 3
If there is any situation wherein we might need to go beyond nesting depth of 3
we can use a sub query
